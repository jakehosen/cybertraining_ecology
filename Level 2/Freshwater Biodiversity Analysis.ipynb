These ordination approaches take datasets with many variables (also known as high dimensional data) and use a statistical approach to reduce the number of variables/dimensions. We will explore three of these approaches Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), and Correspondence Analysis.\n",
