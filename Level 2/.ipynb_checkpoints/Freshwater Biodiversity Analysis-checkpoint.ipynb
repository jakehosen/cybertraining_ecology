These ordination approaches take datasets with many variables (also known as high dimensional data) and use a statistical approach to reduce the number of variables/dimensions. We will explore three of these approaches Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), and Correspondence Analysis.\n",

This is beneficial because it can work with datasets that do not meet assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, but makes the exact placement of points on the ordination more difficult to interpret.\n",
