The key variable that is important here is gas exchange, which is parameterized by _K600<sub>d</sub>, which captures the rate of gas exchange between air and water. In streams and rivers, gas exchange is primarily driven by turbulence, which varies predictably with river flow rate. By contrast, in lake ecosystems, wind driven turbulence, solar convection, water color, and lake size all determine the rate of gas exchange. Thus, a number of variables are required to fully quantify gas exchange in lakes.\n",

The cool bottom layer is known as the hypolimnion and is typically a dark environment where oxygen supplies can be limited.\n",
